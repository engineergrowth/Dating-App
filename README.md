# Pucker Up

Pucker Up is a dating web application developed as part of my Fullstack Academy capstone project. The app allows users to create profiles, browse other profiles, and engage in real-time messaging, all built with Node.js, Express, React, and Prisma. It incorporates a matching system where users can "heart" profiles, and if both users heart each other, they are matched and can chat via WebSockets.

## Features

- **Create Profile**: Users can create and manage their profile with details like name, photo, and bio.
- **View Profiles**: Browse through other users' profiles.
- **Heart Profiles**: Express interest in other profiles by sending a "heart."
- **Matching System**: When two users heart each other, they are considered a match and can chat.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can message their matches instantly using WebSockets.
- **Matches View**: View all your matches in a dedicated section.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend logic for the server.
- **Express**: Framework for building the API.
- **React**: Frontend user interface.
- **Prisma**: ORM for managing database interactions.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time messaging between users.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: For authentication.
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing and security.

## Team Collaboration

This project was developed collaboratively with my team using GitHub for version control, pull requests for code reviews, and a project board for task management. We followed Agile methodologies to ensure efficient and organized development.
